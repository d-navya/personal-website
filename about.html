            <p class="bio">Hello, Iâ€™m D Navya ! Iâ€™m a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, which basically means I spend most of my time solving problems, writing code, and occasionally wondering why my program isnâ€™t running (spoiler: i have weird variable names and i forget lolz pls don't attack me i'm working on it).
                <br>
                I love working on algorithms, AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, and Iâ€™ve built projects on urban navigation, network security, AI music processing, and data compression. If itâ€™s something techy and challenging, Iâ€™m probably interested.
                <br>
                When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me listening to music or laughing, crying, and awing at some Adam Sandler movies. (Yes, I have excellent taste ðŸ™„)</p>
