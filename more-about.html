            <h2>my fav 5 movies so far(not in order)</h2>
            <ul class="favorites-list">
                <li>1. Shutter Island </li>
                <p>
                    This movie messes me up every single time. The tension is suffocating and one of Leo's best performances imo. That final line is pure psychological warfare. No matter how many times I watch it, I walk away questioning everything.
                </p>
                <li>2. The Truman Show</li>
                <p>The gaslighting in this movie is insane. The entire world is in on it, and Truman is just supposed to accept that. Jim Carrey dials down the comedy and somehow makes it even more weird and unsettling to watch. That last scene when he finally walked out of the simulation was FLAWLESS.
                </p>
                <li>3. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</li>
                <p>
                    Unhinged behavior at its finest. Andie is a menace who gaslights, gatekeeps and girlbosses(me). Ben has no idea what’s happening but still thinks he’s in control. The entire relationship is built on pure delusion, and it works. The “You're so vain” karaoke scene alone is enough to call this one of the best rom-coms.
                </p>
                <li>4. Interstellar</li>
                <p>
                    This movie made me sad. The 23-year time skip sent me spiraling. Murph ignoring Cooper’s messages while he just sits there watching was brutal. Hans Zimmer went so hard. The space visuals are cool and all but nothing wrecks me like that bookshelf scene. This movie was literally an experience.
                </p>
                <li>5. Black Swan</li>
                <p>
                    Black Swan is probably one of the best psychological thrillers out there. Natalie Portman is unreal as Nina, the ballerina who goes from only wanting perfection to losing her mind. The whole movie is like a slow burn of delusion, with some wild hallucinations and a plot that leaves you questioning what's real. The dance scenes and the breakdowns were so beautiful. By the end of this movie I was left thinking "literally what happened" and that's exactly why it works.

            <h2>subjects i've liked through 4 semesters</h2>
            <ul class="favorites-list">
                <li>1. DSA</li>
                <p>
                    Algorithms are fun. I love pattern recognition. Just figuring things out, step by step, feels like a solid mental workout.
                </p>
                <li>2. Robotics</li>
                <p>
                    I enjoy solving the rotation and transformation matrices, even though I'm not sure about my grades here. But hey, building stuff and making it work is what matters.
                </p>
                <li>3. OS</li>
                <p>
                    The algorithms were cool, but what really got me was learning what the CPU does and how it all works. It’s cute when you dive into it.
                </p>
                <li>4. ML</li>
                <p>
                    Hated it at first. Spent too much time messing with the dataset, dropping features, changing them, all that. But once I got past that, seeing how algorithms classify, predict, and learn was pretty fascinating.
                </p>
                <li>5. Computer Networks</li>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of our course, i got to work on ARP spoofing and mitigation techniques. That project was pretty awesome and it helped me actually learn real-world security stuff.
